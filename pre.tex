\textbf{Caveat} \\
I am very happy to release \emph{my own text and figures} without any restrictions whatsoever.
As far as I am concerned, any \emph{attribution is very much appreciated} but it is not required.
However, this does not except anyone from following the academic practices on attribution as applicable to them.
Also, I must note that throughout this thesis I have used several excerpts of others' text, images and code, which I have always been careful to mark as such.
While I am myself allowed to use these excerpts under legal \emph{fair use} doctrines in many countries and more specifically by the citation right (\emph{citaatrecht}) in \href{http://wetten.overheid.nl/jci1.3:c:BWBR0001886&hoofdstuk=I&paragraaf=6&artikel=15a&z=2015-07-01&g=2015-07-01}{Article 15a of the Dutch Copyright Law} (\emph{Auteurswet}), this does not mean that you are also free to use these excerpts for any purpose.

\textbf{Colophon} \\
This thesis was typeset with \XeTeX\ 3.14159265--2.6--0.99992 (\TeX\ Live 2015) using the \mbox{{\fanciestfont{}Feijoa}}, \texttt{GT Pressura} and $\mathrm{Asana\ Math}$ typefaces.
Most of the figures were created using OmniGraffle, Affinity Designer or Blender, often with the help of \LaTeX{}\textsuperscript{i}T.

\textbf{Cover} \\
Model of a 4D house represented as a 4D cell complex.
The cells of the model were manually defined and embedded in $\mathbb{R}^4$, projected inwards/outwards to the volume of a 3-sphere ($S^3$), stereographically projected to $\mathbb{R}^3$ and exported as an\ {}.obj file.
This was then imported in Blender and rendered using a perspective projection down to 2D.
See \refse{se:4dto3d} for more details.
